I’m Harsh Jasrapuria, a data geek with a passion for turning messy data into slick dashboards and smart automations—currently diving deep into business analytics at UC San Diego. From building ML-powered workflows at Deloitte to optimizing airport ops with 2M+ data points, I’m all about mixing tech and strategy to make things run smoother (and faster!).
